# BCD_Adder
BCD stands for binary coded decimal. It is used to perform the addition of BCD numbers.
A BCD digit can have any of ten possible four-bit representations. Suppose, we have two 4-bit numbers A and B. The value of A and B can vary from 0(0000 in binary) to 9(1001 in binary) because we are considering decimal numbers.
